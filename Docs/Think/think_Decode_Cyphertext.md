The decryption process should use the encrypted hash generated by `encode_json_to_ciphertext` (via OpenSSL) and attempt to decrypt it using both `../Passwords/correctpass.txt` and `../Passwords/wrongpass.txt`. The goal is to verify the correctness of the password and return the decrypted JSON string if successful, or a failure message otherwise.

### Function Signature:
```m
function result = decode_from_ciphertext(encrypted_hash, pass)
```
- **`encrypted_hash`**: The encrypted data (as a hexadecimal or base64 string) generated by `encode_json_to_ciphertext`.
- **`pass`**: The password used for decryption, provided either as a string or a path to a `.txt` file (e.g., `../Passwords/correctpass.txt` or `../Passwords/wrongpass.txt`).

---

### Workflow:
1. **Handle the Password Input**:
   - If `pass` is a file path (ends with `.txt`), read the password from the file using `fileread`.
   - If `pass` is a string, use it directly as the password.

2. **Derive the AES-256 Key**:
   - Use the same key derivation method (e.g., PBKDF2) as in `encode_json_to_ciphertext` to ensure consistency.

3. **Decrypt the Hash**:
   - Use AES-256 (in CBC or GCM mode) to decrypt the `encrypted_hash`.
   - If decryption succeeds, return the decrypted JSON string and print it.
   - If decryption fails (e.g., due to a wrong password), return a failure message: `"Decryption failed: Incorrect password or corrupted data."`.

---

### Example Usage:
```m
% Attempt decryption with the correct password
result = decode_from_ciphertext(encrypted_data, "../Passwords/correctpass.txt");

% Attempt decryption with the wrong password
result = decode_from_ciphertext(encrypted_data, "../Passwords/wrongpass.txt");
```

---

### Output:
- **Success**: Print the decrypted JSON string and return it.
- **Failure**: Return and display: `"Decryption failed: Incorrect password or corrupted data."`

---

### Notes:
- Ensure the decryption process mirrors the encryption process (e.g., same mode, padding, and key derivation).
- Use OpenSSL or a compatible Octave library for AES-256 decryption, as Octave lacks native support.
